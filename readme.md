# A toDoApp from Scratch

The main goal of this project is to practice 
OOP programming. 

## Router
* `Router` class */src/classes/router.php*
* `routes.php` file */routes.php*

### Routing process

Within the `bootstrap.php` we initiate a router object. In `routes.php` we map all
URIs to the corresponding controller and use the `define()` method to assign these 
mappings to the `$routes` property of the object.
